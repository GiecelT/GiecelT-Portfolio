									<h2>Interest</h2>
									<p>
										I am a full-time student at Bellevue College working towards
										a Bachelors Degree in Software Development. My interest in 
										this career field started when I was a Junior in high school taking 
										a field trip to Google. I was in awe by how amazing the campus was and
										how the employees were able to work in such a fun environment. I knew then
										that I wanted to work in the tech industry. 
									</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Hobbies</h2>
									<p>
										When I am not studying or working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. 
										I love to travel and explore new places when I can. I also enjoy reading books, 
										watching movies, playing video games, and cooking.
									<hr />
									<h2>Achievements</h2>
									<p>
										One of my biggest achievements was being able to graduate from high school and 
										attend college. I am the first in my family to attend college and I am proud of 
										myself for being able to get this far. I have also been able to maintain a 3.5 GPA 
										throughout my college career.
									</p>
